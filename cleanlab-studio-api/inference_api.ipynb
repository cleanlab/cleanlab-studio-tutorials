    "In this tutorial, we'll use Cleanlab Studio to train a reliable ML model on raw data and deploy it in production with a single click. Using the deployed model, we can obtain predictions on new data using Cleanlab Studio's Python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Model training and deployment pipeline overview](../assets/inference-tutorial/mldeployment.png)\n",

    "We'll work with a [dataset](https://data.dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/largescaleproductcorpus/data/amazon_training.json.gzip) from Web Data Commons where the ML task is to classify products based on their text descriptions. This text classification dataset contains titles, descriptions, and category labels for 23,000 products on Amazon. It looks like this:\n",

    "![Product Descriptions Dataset](../assets/inference-tutorial/dataset_preview.png)\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "For online retailers like Amazon, product classification is a highly important task. Reliable product classification allows customers to find products and retailers to suggest related products — both of which are crucial to making sales and generating revenue!\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any classification task, the quality of the data going in has a tremendous effect on the quality of the inferences generated by the model. For a retailer like Amazon, the initial labels might be created by a team of annotators who are paid for each example they annotate. The quality of these labels will not always be high.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying data itself can be suspect. Datasets will often contain duplicate, null, or corrupted examples — all of which will impact the performance of the model trained on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Cleanlab Studio, training a model begins with cleaning your dataset, a process made easy by our algorithms which automatically find data and label issues and recommend actions to fix them. Once you have a clean dataset, with a single click, Cleanlab Studio's autoML can train and deploy a reliable model suitable for use in a production setting."
