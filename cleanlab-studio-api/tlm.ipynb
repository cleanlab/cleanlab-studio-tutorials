If you have the time/resources, consider manually correcting those responses flagged as low-quality where you spot obvious room for improvement.

    "**Note**: This beta version of TLM is not yet optimized for speed (or long contexts).  Focus mainly on the quality of the results you’re getting, and know that the inference latency (and context length) will be greatly improved shortly as we build out the supporting infrastructure.  This beta version does not yet support batching, so for now use a `for` loop to iterate over a dataset of many prompts. If getting results is taking really long, there may be too many TLM users hitting rate limits, in which case try: decreasing the `quality_preset`, shortening your prompt, or waiting until later to use it. We are increasing our infrastructure capacity to meet the surging beta demand."
