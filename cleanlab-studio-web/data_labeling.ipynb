    "This tutorial shows how to use Cleanlab Studio for labeling a classification dataset, when only a subset of the data is labeled. Cleanlab Studio expedites this process by predicting labels for your unlabeled data and reporting confidence scores for each prediction, so you know which subset of the data can be auto-labeled with confidence.\n",

    "Cleanlab's predictions come from combining Foundation models (that rely on pre-trained world knowledge) with supervised ML models trained on your existing labeled data (that learn domain-specific patterns in your data).\n",
    "The Web Inferface supports a human-in-the-loop data labeling workflow, where you can review and accept proposed labels from Cleanlab's ML model, and with one click, retrain the ML model to learn from the additional supervision information provided in your latest labels. The retrained ML model becomes more confident and accurate as more data is labeled, so iterating this labeling/retraining process enables a single user to label large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend starting with at least 5 labeled examples per class. For datasets that are under 50% labeled, a special *auto-labeling wizard* will automatically guide you through the first cycle of data labeling + model retraining (if you run a **Regular** mode Project).\n",
    "After this initial round of auto-labeling, Cleanlab Studio will also automatically detect [data and labeling issues](/guide/concepts/cleanlab_columns) that you can address while continuing to label more data."

    "The estimated threshold may be imperfect, so consider adjusting it prior to auto-labeling. Inspect some rows above and below the threshold. Decrease the threshold value if the suggested labels for rows below the threshold look correct; increase it if suggested labels for rows above the threshold don't look correct. Adjust the threshold by changing the row number in `Threshold Row` box above the data table or using the `Set as threshold` button.\n",

Here we recommend labeling some of the lowest-confidence examples in the dataset.  These data points will be most informative for re-training Cleanlab's ML model, which can be then be used to auto-label more data with greater accuracy/confidence. The more data you label, the better Cleanlab's ML system will get after re-training. You can use the `Skip` button if you don\u2019t want to label any data yourself.\n",

This subsequent part of the workflow is equivalent to a typical Cleanlab Studio Project for datasets that are over 50% labeled.\n",
