    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use Cleanlab Studio to train a model on a multi-label dataset and deploy it in a single click. Using the deployed model, you can make predictions on new data points in the Cleanlab Studio web app. The same steps can also be used to deploy models for multi-class datasets. Model inference is also supported through the [Python API](/tutorials/inference_api).\n",

We will use a train-test split to demo model inference, where we use the first 80% of the data (69364 rows) for training. After the model is trained in Cleanlab Studio, we can use it to predict labels on new data. We demonstrate this by removing the labels from the last 20% of the data, and using the trained model to infer their labels. In real-world use, you can use the trained model to predict labels on new data, where the label is not already known.\n",
