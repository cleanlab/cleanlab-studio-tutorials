    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses an E-Commerce dataset with images of boots, sandals, and shoes. Download it [here](https://s.cleanlab.ai/footwear-demo.zip). While we use image data as an example here, the steps in this tutorial can be applied to text and structured/tabular datasets as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, [upload your dataset](/guide/quickstart/web/#upload-a-dataset) to Cleanlab Studio. Then [create a Project](/guide/quickstart/web/#create-a-project-to-detect-data-and-label-issues), which is an automated Cleanlab analysis of your dataset that includes suggested corrections to improve the dataset. For help with these steps, check out the [Web Quickstart guide](/guide/quickstart/web/)."

    "Inside of your [Project](/guide/concepts/projects) you will find the Filter bar above the dataset and the Analytics tab at the top of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Analytics page provides you with visual representations of your dataset in the form of **clickable** graphs and charts while the Filter tab enables you to display subsets of your data by filtering by values in each of the columns. You can use them in combination to learn about your dataset.\n",

    "1. Use the Analytics tab to gain a deeper understanding of your data and the issues within. You may find useful insights such as a specific class that is commonly mistaken for another.\n",
    "2. Using this knowledge, focus your attention on specific subsets of the data using the Filters. This allows you to work on correcting similar errors which produces faster and more accurate corrections as you're not context-switching between different classes and issues. "

    "Each of the graphics includes a detailed explanation on what they are representing. Let's take a closer look at the `Most Frequently Suggested Label Corrections` graph which breaks down the different types of potential label errors in your dataset. Each row shows the number of examples which have a `Given` Label in your dataset that Cleanlab Studio believes should be corrected to the `Suggested` Label.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Suggested label correction graph.](../assets/understanding-data-tutorial/label-corrections.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph is a great place to understand the relationship of label errors between classes. You can see above that the most common suggested correction is images labeled as `shoe` but should actually be `boot`, with 16 data points. This means that your dataset has many images of boots that are improperly labeled as shoes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know a bunch of the `shoe`->`boot` errors exist, simply click on the bar in the chart to automatically filter your dataset to display those specific errors.\n",

For the majority of corrections you make on this subset of the data, you will only have to answer the question \"Is this a boot or a shoe?\" and not \"Is this a boot, shoe, or sandal?\". For this dataset with only 3 classes, this might not be a huge time-saver, but for a dataset with 10+ classes you can easily imagine the efficiency gained by narrowing down the choices per correction.\n",

    "Although the Analytics page enables you to filter the data in meaningful ways by clicking in certain bars, you may also want to set more complex filters to view custom subsets of the data (perhaps to correct a subset all at once). By default, on the Filter bar you can filter the data based on their `Given` or  `Suggested` label, as well as which data are detected to exhibit which `Issues`. If you want to set an additional filter (or multiple) click `Add New Filter` and select the desired filter.\n",
