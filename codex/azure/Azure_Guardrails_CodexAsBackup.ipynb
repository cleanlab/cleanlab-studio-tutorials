    "\n",
    "## 1. Free Shipping Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Eligibility Criteria\n",
    "- Free shipping is available on all orders over $50 within the continental United States.\n",
    "- For orders under $50, a flat rate shipping fee of $5.99 will be applied.\n",
    "- Free shipping is not available for expedited shipping methods (e.g., overnight or 2-day shipping).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Exclusions\n",
    "- Free shipping does not apply to orders shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, or international destinations.\n",
    "- Oversized or heavy items may incur additional shipping charges, which will be clearly communicated to the customer before purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Handling Customer Inquiries\n",
    "- If a customer inquires about free shipping eligibility, verify the order total and shipping destination.\n",
    "- Inform customers of ways to qualify for free shipping (e.g., adding items to reach the $50 threshold).\n",
    "- For orders just below the threshold, you may offer a one-time courtesy free shipping if it's the customer's first purchase or if they have a history of large orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Processing & Delivery Timeframes\n",
    "- Standard orders are processed within 1 business day; during peak periods (e.g., holidays) allow up to 3 business days.  \n",
    "- Delivery via ground service typically takes 3-7 business days depending on destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Shipment Tracking & Notifications\n",
    "- A tracking link must be emailed automatically once the carrier scans the package.  \n",
    "- Agents may resend tracking links on request and walk customers through carrier websites if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Lost-Package Resolution\n",
    "1. File a tracer with the carrier if a package shows no movement for 7 calendar days.\n",
    "2. Offer either a replacement shipment or a full refund once the carrier confirms loss.  \n",
    "3. Document the outcome in the order record for analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.7 Sustainability & Packaging Standards\n",
    "- Use recyclable or recycled-content packaging whenever available.  \n",
    "- Consolidate items into a single box to minimize waste unless it risks damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Free Returns Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Eligibility Criteria\n",
    "- Free returns are available for all items within 30 days of the delivery date.\n",
    "- Items must be unused, unworn, and in their original packaging with all tags attached.\n",
    "- Free returns are limited to standard shipping methods within the continental United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Exclusions\n",
    "- Final sale items, as marked on the product page, are not eligible for free returns.\n",
    "- Customized or personalized items are not eligible for free returns unless there is a manufacturing defect.\n",
    "- Undergarments, swimwear, and earrings are not eligible for free returns due to hygiene reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Process for Handling Returns\n",
    "1. Verify the order date and ensure it falls within the 30-day return window.\n",
    "2. Ask the customer about the reason for the return and document it in the system.\n",
    "3. Provide the customer with a prepaid return label if they qualify for free returns.\n",
    "4. Inform the customer of the expected refund processing time (5-7 business days after receiving the return).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Exceptions\n",
    "- For items damaged during shipping or with manufacturing defects, offer an immediate replacement or refund without requiring a return.\n",
    "- For returns outside the 30-day window, use discretion based on the customer's history and the reason for the late return. You may offer store credit as a compromise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Return Package Preparation Guidelines\n",
    "- Instruct customers to reuse the original box when possible and to cushion fragile items.  \n",
    "- Advise removing or obscuring any prior shipping labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6 Inspection & Restocking Procedures\n",
    "- Returns are inspected within 48 hours of arrival.  \n",
    "- Items passing inspection are restocked; those failing inspection follow the disposal flow in \u00a7 2.8.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3. Fraud Detection Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Red Flags for Potential Fraud\n",
    "- Multiple orders from the same IP address with different customer names or shipping addresses.\n",
    "- Orders with unusually high quantities of the same item.\n",
    "- Shipping address different from the billing address, especially if in different countries.\n",
    "- Multiple failed payment attempts followed by a successful one.\n",
    "- Customers pressuring for immediate shipping or threatening to cancel the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Verification Process\n",
    "1. For orders flagging as potentially fraudulent, place them on hold for review.\n",
    "2. Verify the customer's identity by calling the phone number on file.\n",
    "3. Request additional documentation (e.g., photo ID, credit card statement) if necessary.\n",
    "4. Cross-reference the shipping address with known fraud databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Actions for Confirmed Fraud\n",
    "- Cancel the order immediately and refund any charges.\n",
    "- Document the incident in the customer's account and flag it for future reference.\n",
    "- Report confirmed fraud cases to the appropriate authorities and credit card companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 False Positives\n",
    "- If a legitimate customer is flagged, apologize for the inconvenience and offer a small discount or free shipping on their next order.\n",
    "- Document the incident to improve our fraud detection algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Chargeback Response Procedure\n",
    "1. Gather all order evidence (invoice, shipment tracking, customer communications).  \n",
    "2. Submit documentation to the processor within 3 calendar days of chargeback notice.  \n",
    "3. Follow up weekly until the dispute is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6 Data Security & Privacy Compliance\n",
    "- Store verification documents in an encrypted, access-controlled folder.  \n",
    "- Purge personally identifiable information after 180 days unless required for ongoing legal action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7 Continuous Improvement & Training\n",
    "- Run quarterly reviews of fraud rules with data analytics.  \n",
    "- Provide annual anti-fraud training to all front-line staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.8 Record-Keeping Requirements\n",
    "- Maintain a log of all fraud reviews\u2014including false positives\u2014for 3 years to support audits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Customer Interaction Tone\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 General Guidelines\n",
    "- Always maintain a professional, friendly, and empathetic tone.\n",
    "- Use the customer's name when addressing them.\n",
    "- Listen actively and paraphrase the customer's concerns to ensure understanding.\n",
    "- Avoid negative language; focus on what can be done rather than what can't.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Specific Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Angry or Frustrated Customers\n",
    "- Remain calm and do not take comments personally.\n",
    "- Acknowledge the customer's feelings and apologize for their negative experience.\n",
    "- Focus on finding a solution and clearly explain the steps you'll take to resolve the issue.\n",
    "- If necessary, offer to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confused or Indecisive Customers\n",
    "- Be patient and offer clear, concise explanations.\n",
    "- Ask probing questions to better understand their needs.\n",
    "- Provide options and explain the pros and cons of each.\n",
    "- Offer to send follow-up information via email if the customer needs time to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### VIP or Loyal Customers\n",
    "- Acknowledge their status and thank them for their continued business.\n",
    "- Be familiar with their purchase history and preferences.\n",
    "- Offer exclusive deals or early access to new products when appropriate.\n",
    "- Go above and beyond to exceed their expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Language and Phrasing\n",
    "- Use positive language: \"I'd be happy to help you with that\" instead of \"I can't do that.\"\n",
    "- Avoid technical jargon or abbreviations that customers may not understand.\n",
    "- Use \"we\" statements to show unity with the company: \"We value your feedback\" instead of \"The company values your feedback.\"\n",
    "- End conversations on a positive note: \"Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Written Communication\n",
    "- Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation in all written communications.\n",
    "- Keep emails and chat responses concise and to the point.\n",

    "- Avoid emojis in formal email; limited, brand-approved emojis allowed in chat or social when matching customer tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.8 Proactive Outreach & Follow-Up\n",

    "- Tag VIP accounts for quarterly \u201cthank-you\u201d notes highlighting new offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.9 Documentation of Customer Interactions\n",

      "- We offer free standard shipping on all orders over $50 within the continental United States.\n",
      "- For orders under $50, a flat rate shipping fee of $5.99 applies.\n",
      "- Free shipping is not available for expedited shipping methods such as overnight or 2-day shipping.\n",
      "- Please note that free shipping does not apply to orders shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, or international destinations.\n",
      "- Oversized or heavy items may have additional shipping charges, which we communicate clearly before purchase.\n",
      "- Standard orders are processed within 1 business day (up to 3 during peak times), and delivery via ground service typically takes 3-7 business days depending on your location.\n",
      "- Once your package ships, you'll receive a tracking link via email to monitor your delivery.\n",
