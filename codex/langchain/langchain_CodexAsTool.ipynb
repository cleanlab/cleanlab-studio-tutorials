    "**Adding Codex only improves your RAG app.** Once integrated, Codex automatically logs all user queries that your original RAG app handles poorly. Using a [simple web interface](/codex/sme_tutorials/codex_as_sme/), SMEs at your company can answer the highest priority questions in the Codex Project. As soon as an answer is entered in Codex, your RAG app will be able to properly handle all similar questions encountered in the future.\n",
