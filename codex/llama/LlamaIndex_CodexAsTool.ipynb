    "\n",
    "Now that Codex is integrated with your RAG app, you and SMEs can [open the Codex Project and answer questions](/codex/sme_tutorials/codex_as_sme/) logged there to continuously improve your AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding Codex only improves your RAG app.** Once integrated, Codex automatically logs all user queries that your original RAG app handles poorly. Using a [simple web interface](/codex/sme_tutorials/codex_as_sme/), SMEs at your company can answer the highest priority questions in the Codex Project. As soon as an answer is entered in Codex, your RAG app will be able to properly handle all similar questions encountered in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Codex is **the fastest way for nontechnical SMEs to directly improve your AI application**. As the Developer, you simply integrate Codex once, and from then on, SMEs can continuously improve how your AI handles common user queries without needing your help.\n",
