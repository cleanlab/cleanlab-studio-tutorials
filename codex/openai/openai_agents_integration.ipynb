    "## How Cleanlab Validation Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleanlab evaluates AI responses across multiple dimensions (trustworthiness, helpfulness, reasoning quality, etc.) and provides scores, guardrail decisions, and expert remediation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed information on Cleanlab's validation methodology, see:\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated integrating Cleanlab validation with OpenAI Agents using validation hooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-time validation** during response generation\n",
    "- **Automatic remediation** with expert answers and fallbacks\n",
    "- **Context-aware validation** for retrieval-based agents\n",
    "- **Session management** for persistent conversation history\n",
    "- **Minimal code changes** to existing OpenAI Agent applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `CleanlabHook` with your project\n",
    "2. Specify `context_retrieval_tools` for better validation\n",
    "3. Pass the hook to `Runner.run()` along with session and context\n",
    "4. Access validation results from the context object\n",
    "\n",
    "The hook-based approach provides enterprise-grade safety with minimal code changes to your existing OpenAI Agent workflows."
