Once integrated, the Codex Project automatically logs all user queries that your original RAG app handles poorly. Using a [simple web interface](/codex/web_tutorials/codex_as_sme/), SMEs at your company can answer the highest priority questions in the Codex Project. As soon as an answer is entered in Codex, your RAG app will be able to properly handle all similar questions encountered in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "Codex is **the fastest way for nontechnical SMEs to directly improve your RAG app**. As the Developer, you simply integrate Codex once, and from then on, SMEs can continuously improve how your AI handles common user queries without needing your help. Codex works with *any* RAG architecture, so Developers can independently improve the RAG system in other ways with their new free time. \n",

    "This tutorial demonstrated a single-turn Q&A app, but you can easily [extend this code into a conversational app](/codex/tutorials/other_rag_frameworks/OtherRAG_ToolCalls/#conversational-rag-multi-turn-dialogues) (multi-turn chat).\n",
