    "# Detect and remediate bad responses from Tool Calling AI applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebok demonstrates how to automatically improve any Tool Calling AI application by integrating Cleanlab. \n",

Advanced Usage is covered in our [Detect and remediate bad responses from conversational RAG applications](/codex/tutorials/other_rag_frameworks/validator_conversational/) tutorial. We recommend connecting your Tool-Calling AI Agents to a *separate* Cleanlab Project from your Q&A / Chat AI Agents.\n",

    "**Adding Cleanlab only improves your Tool Calling AI app.** Once integrated, it automatically identifies problematic responses and either remediates them with expert answers or logs them for review. Using a [simple web interface](/codex/web_tutorials/codex_as_sme/), SMEs at your company can answer the highest priority questions in the Cleanab Project. As soon as an answer is entered in the Project, your AI app will be able to properly handle all similar questions encountered in the future.\n",
