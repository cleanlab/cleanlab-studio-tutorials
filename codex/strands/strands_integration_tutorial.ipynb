    "1. **Identifies the problematic turn**: Finds the conversation turn that produced the bad response\n",
    "2. **Removes tool calls**: Eliminates the assistant message containing tool calls from history\n",

    "4. **Preserves user messages**: Keeps user queries to maintain conversation context\n",
