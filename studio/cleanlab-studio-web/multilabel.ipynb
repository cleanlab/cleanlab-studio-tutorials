While this tutorial focuses on image data, Cleanlab Studio enables you to do all of the same things demonstrated here for multi-label text or structured/tabular datasets as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the \"images with metadata\" format for uploading data to Cleanlab Studio, where data is formatted as a ZIP file containing:\n",
    "- Image folder: collection of images stored in a directory\n",
    "- `metadata.csv`: file containing filepath and labels for each of the images (requires specific format for multi-label data)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few sections will walk through how to transform the Kaggle version of CelebA, specifically the attributes dataset (`list_attr_celeba.csv`), into the required format using [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/), a spreadsheet editor. Note that this process can be applied to any multi-label dataset by adapting the formatting to your specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to skip ahead, you can download the dataset formatted for Cleanlab Studio [here](https://cleanlab-public.s3.amazonaws.com/Datasets/celeba.zip).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `list_attr_celeba.csv` file from Kaggle is structured in a *one-hot-encoding* format. Each column represents a specific class label (e.g. `Smiling`, `Black_Hair`). A value of `1` indicates that the class applies to the given image, while a `-1` signifies that it does not. In order for Cleanlab Studio to analyze multi-label data, your class labels must be formatted as a comma-separated list of applicable attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Change in format of multi-label data.](./assets/multilabel-tutorial/data-formatting.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is a simplified version of how you are required to reformat this multi-label dataset. In the original dataset on the left, each of the class labels `Male`, `Glasses`, `Smiling` are represented as columns, with `1`s and `-1`s indicating if they apply to the given image. Looking at image C (row 3), all three of the class labels have `1`s, which means all three of them apply to the image of the smiling man wearing glasses. To format this properly, combine all of the applicable class labels for each image and separate them with commas (no spaces in between) like this `Male,Glasses,Smiling`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following these steps will transform the original dataset from Kaggle to a format understood by Cleanlab Studio:\n",
    "- Apply formula to convert from `1`s and `-1`s to list of class labels\n",
    "- Apply formula to add the parent folder name to the `image_id` to create a filepath\n",
    "- Remove unnecessary columns\n",
    "- Export CSV as `metadata.csv`\n",
    "- Add `metadata.csv` inside of the images folder\n",
    "- Zip the images folder\n",

    "Breaking down the formula: `=ARRAYFORMULA(TEXTJOIN(\",\", TRUE, IF(C2:AP2=1, $C$1:$AP$1, \"\")))}}`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ARRAYFORMULA(function)**:\n",
    "    - This function allows you to apply a function or formula over a range (an array) rather than a single cell. However, in this specific formula, it's not being fully utilized to process multiple rows at once, but rather to ensure that the inner functions handle arrays properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TEXTJOIN(delimiter, ignore_empty, array1, ...)**:\n",
    "    - This function joins multiple values (from arrays or ranges) into one string.\n",
    "    - `delimiter`: Specifies the character or string to insert between each text item in the resulting string. Here, we're using `\",\"`, which means we want to separate the values with a comma (with no space in between).\n",
    "    - `ignore_empty`: If `TRUE`, the function will skip any empty values or arrays. This ensures that we don't have unnecessary commas in the result.\n",
    "    - `array1, ...`: The arrays or ranges to join. In this formula, the array is produced by the `IF` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **IF(test, value_if_true, value_if_false)**:\n",
    "    - This function returns one value if a logical test is `TRUE` and another value if it's `FALSE`.\n",
    "    - `test`: The logical test we're checking. In this case, we're testing if each cell in the range `C2:AP2` equals 1.\n",
    "    - `value_if_true`: The value to return if the test is true. Here, we're returning the corresponding header from the range `$C$1:$AP$1`.\n",
    "    - `value_if_false`: The value to return if the test is false. We're returning an empty string (`\"\"`), meaning if the cell doesn't contain a 1, it doesn't contribute to the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in simpler terms, here's how the formula operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each cell in `C2:AP2`, it checks if the value is 1.\n",
    "- If the value is 1, it captures the corresponding header from `C1:AP1`.\n",
    "- It then takes all the captured headers and joins them into a single string, separated by a comma.\n",
    "- The result is a comma-separated list of headers where the values in `C2:AP2` are 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if `C2` has a value of 1 and its corresponding header in `C1` is \"Male\", and if `D2` doesn't have a value of 1, but `E2` does and its header in `E1` is \"Tall\", the formula's output for row 2 will be \"Male,Tall\"."
