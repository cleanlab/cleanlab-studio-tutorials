# Welcome to the Cleanlab Studio tutorials! 

Here you can find step-by-step tutorials to apply Cleanlab Studio to specific types of datasets and business problems.

On the left you will find the individual tutorials organized by workflow: Web Interface, Python API. The Web Interface tutorials are very simple and no-code. The Python API tutorials are runnable Jupyter notebooks. Unless one data modality is specified in the title, every tutorial is applicable to all types of data that Cleanlab Studio supports: image, text, and structured/tabular datasets.
