       "      <td>Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons, has garnered significant interest in the search for extraterrestrial life due to several compelling scientific findings. Here\u2019s an analysis of the potential for life on Enceladus based on current knowledge:\\n\\n### 1. **Subsurface Ocean**\\nOne of the most promising aspects of Enceladus is the presence of a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust. Data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, indicated that Enceladus has a global ocean of liquid water beneath its surface. This ocean is believed to be in contact with the moon's rocky core, which is crucial for the potential for life, as it could provide the necessary chemical interactions.\\n\\n### 2. **Hydrothermal Activity**\\nCassini's observations revealed plumes of water vapor and ice particles erupting from the moon's south pole. These plumes contain not only water but also organic molecules and salts, suggesting that hydrothermal activity may be occurring on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents on Earth are known to support diverse ecosystems, and similar environments on Enceladus could potentially harbor microbial life.\\n\\n### 3. **Organic Compounds**\\nThe analysis of the plumes has detected organic compounds, including simple hydrocarbons. While these compounds are not definitive evidence of life, they are essential building blocks for life as we know it. The presence of these organic materials, combined with liquid water and energy sources from hydrothermal activity, creates a potentially habitable environment.\\n\\n### 4. **Energy Sources**\\nFor life to exist, it requires energy. The potential hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor could provide the necessary energy through chemical reactions, similar to those that sustain life in Earth's deep oceans. Additionally, the interaction between the ocean and the rocky core could produce a variety of chemical nutrients.\\n\\n### 5. **Chemical Equilibrium**\\nThe presence of molecular hydrogen (H\u2082) detected in the plumes suggests that there may be chemical processes occurring that could support life. On Earth, hydrogen is often associated with microbial life, particularly in environments like hydrothermal vents.\\n\\n### 6. **Icy Surface and Protection**\\nEnceladus's thick ice shell provides a protective barrier against cosmic radiation and other environmental factors that could be harmful to potential life forms. This insulation could help maintain a stable environment for life to thrive in the subsurface ocean.\\n\\n### 7. **Comparative Planetology**\\nThe study of extremophiles on Earth\u2014organisms that thrive in extreme</td>\n",

       "      <td>The primary reason Venus has not been colonized, despite its similar size and gravity to Earth, is its extremely hostile environment. Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, leading to surface temperatures around 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit). This intense heat, combined with crushing atmospheric pressure about 92 times that of Earth, makes the surface of Venus incredibly inhospitable for human life and current technology.\\n\\nAdditionally, the lack of water and the presence of corrosive chemicals further complicate the possibility of colonization. While there have been discussions about potential floating colonies in the upper atmosphere, where conditions are less extreme, the challenges of developing the necessary technology and infrastructure for such habitats remain significant. Overall, the extreme environmental conditions are the primary barrier to colonization efforts on Venus.</td>\n",

It also has several other large shield volcanoes.\\n\\n2. **Venus**: Venus has numerous volcanoes, with many large shield volcanoes and evidence of past volcanic activity. Some scientists believe that Venus may still be volcanically active today.\\n\\n3. **Io**: One of Jupiter's moons, Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. It has hundreds of active volcanoes, some of which erupt with lava fountains and plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide.\\n\\n4. **Enceladus**: A moon of Saturn, Enceladus has geysers that erupt water vapor and ice particles, indicating cryovolcanism (cold volcanism). This suggests that there may be subsurface volcanic activity.\\n\\n5. **Triton**: Neptune's largest moon, Triton, shows signs of cryovolcanism as well, with geysers that may be driven by subsurface activity.\\n\\nThese celestial bodies provide fascinating insights into volcanic processes beyond Earth.</td>\n",

       "7   Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons, has garnered significant interest in the search for extraterrestrial life due to several compelling scientific findings. Here\u2019s an analysis of the potential for life on Enceladus based on current knowledge:\\n\\n### 1. **Subsurface Ocean**\\nOne of the most promising aspects of Enceladus is the presence of a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust. Data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, indicated that Enceladus has a global ocean of liquid water beneath its surface. This ocean is believed to be in contact with the moon's rocky core, which is crucial for the potential for life, as it could provide the necessary chemical interactions.\\n\\n### 2. **Hydrothermal Activity**\\nCassini's observations revealed plumes of water vapor and ice particles erupting from the moon's south pole. These plumes contain not only water but also organic molecules and salts, suggesting that hydrothermal activity may be occurring on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents on Earth are known to support diverse ecosystems, and similar environments on Enceladus could potentially harbor microbial life.\\n\\n### 3. **Organic Compounds**\\nThe analysis of the plumes has detected organic compounds, including simple hydrocarbons. While these compounds are not definitive evidence of life, they are essential building blocks for life as we know it. The presence of these organic materials, combined with liquid water and energy sources from hydrothermal activity, creates a potentially habitable environment.\\n\\n### 4. **Energy Sources**\\nFor life to exist, it requires energy. The potential hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor could provide the necessary energy through chemical reactions, similar to those that sustain life in Earth's deep oceans. Additionally, the interaction between the ocean and the rocky core could produce a variety of chemical nutrients.\\n\\n### 5. **Chemical Equilibrium**\\nThe presence of molecular hydrogen (H\u2082) detected in the plumes suggests that there may be chemical processes occurring that could support life. On Earth, hydrogen is often associated with microbial life, particularly in environments like hydrothermal vents.\\n\\n### 6. **Icy Surface and Protection**\\nEnceladus's thick ice shell provides a protective barrier against cosmic radiation and other environmental factors that could be harmful to potential life forms. This insulation could help maintain a stable environment for life to thrive in the subsurface ocean.\\n\\n### 7. **Comparative Planetology**\\nThe study of extremophiles on Earth\u2014organisms that thrive in extreme   \n",

Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, leading to surface temperatures around 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit). This intense heat, combined with crushing atmospheric pressure about 92 times that of Earth, makes the surface of Venus incredibly inhospitable for human life and current technology.\\n\\nAdditionally, the lack of water and the presence of corrosive chemicals further complicate the possibility of colonization. While there have been discussions about potential floating colonies in the upper atmosphere, where conditions are less extreme, the challenges of developing the necessary technology and infrastructure for such habitats remain significant. Overall, the extreme environmental conditions are the primary barrier to colonization efforts on Venus.   \n",

Here are a few:\\n\\n1. **Mars**: Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is about 13.6 miles (22 kilometers) high. It also has several other large shield volcanoes.\\n\\n2. **Venus**: Venus has numerous volcanoes, with many large shield volcanoes and evidence of past volcanic activity. Some scientists believe that Venus may still be volcanically active today.\\n\\n3. **Io**: One of Jupiter's moons, Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. It has hundreds of active volcanoes, some of which erupt with lava fountains and plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide.\\n\\n4. **Enceladus**: A moon of Saturn, Enceladus has geysers that erupt water vapor and ice particles, indicating cryovolcanism (cold volcanism). This suggests that there may be subsurface volcanic activity.\\n\\n5. **Triton**: Neptune's largest moon, Triton, shows signs of cryovolcanism as well, with geysers that may be driven by subsurface activity.\\n\\nThese celestial bodies provide fascinating insights into volcanic processes beyond Earth.   \n",

When using `TLM.get_trustworthiness_score()` to score responses from your own LLM, simply provide the *same* `prompt` used for your own LLM (including any instructions, context, message history, etc).

    "\n",
    "Offline, you can manually review the lowest-trust LLM responses across a dataset and discover insights to [improve your LLM prompts](https://www.promptingguide.ai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-time, you can automatically determine *which* LLM responses are untrustworthy by comparing trustworthiness scores against a fixed threshold (say 0.7).\n",
    "The overall magnitude of trust scores may differ between applications, so select *application-specific* thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For maximally reliable AI applications, you can **escalate untrustworthy LLM responses for human review**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are other **strategies to automatically handle untrustworthy LLM responses** without a human-in-the-loop:\n",
    "   1. Append a warning message/disclaimer to the response.\n",
    "   2. Replace your LLM response with a fallback message such as: \"*Sorry I am unsure. Try rephrasing your request, or contact us*\".\n",
    "   3. In RAG, the fallback message might include raw retrieved context or search-results, for example: \"*Sorry I am unsure. Here's some potentially relevant information: ...*\".\n",
    "   4. Replace your original LLM response with a re-generated response.\n",
    "   5. Escalate to a more expensive AI system (e.g. DeepResearch API).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we showcase example implementations of these strategies. But our *main recommendation* for handling untrustworthy LLM responses is to use [Cleanlab Codex](https://help.cleanlab.ai/codex/) to: log them for remediation, prioritize what to remediate, and serve appropriate remediations for such cases (like expert-provided answers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Append disclaimer to untrustworthy responses\n",
    "\n",
    "One straightforward strategy is to still present untrustworthy LLM responses to your user, but first edit them to make them less misleading. You could append a cautionary warning after the response:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if trustworthiness_score < threshold:  # say 0.7\n",
    "    response = response + \"\\n\\n CAUTION: This answer was flagged as potentially untrustworthy.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you could append a *hedging statement* before the response, making it sound less confident:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if trustworthiness_score < threshold:  # say 0.7\n",
    "    response = \"I'm not sure, but I'd guess:\\n\\n\" + response\n",

The default TLM configuration (used in this tutorial) is **not** latency/cost-optimized because it must remain effective across *all* possible LLM use-cases. For your specific use-case, **you can greatly improve latency/cost without compromising results**. Strategy: first run TLM with default settings to see what results look like over a dataset from your use-case; once results look promising, adjust the TLM preset/options/model to reduce latency for your application. If TLM's default configuration seems ineffective, switch to a more powerful `model` or add [custom evaluation criteria](/tlm/tutorials/tlm_custom_eval/).\n",
