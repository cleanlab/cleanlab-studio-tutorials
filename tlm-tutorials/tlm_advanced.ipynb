    "For your specific use-case, you can **greatly improve latency/cost without compromising results**. Strategy: first run TLM with default settings to see results over a dataset from your use-case; Then adjust the `model`, `quality_preset`, and other `TLMOptions` to reduce latency for your application. If TLM\u2019s default configuration seems ineffective, switch to a more powerful `model` (e.g. o3-mini, o1, or claude-3.5-sonnet-v2) or add [custom evaluation criteria](/tlm/tutorials/tlm_custom_eval/).\n",

    "Medium | Standard | Good\n",
    "Low | Standard | Fair\n",
    "Base | Standard | Lowest latency\n",
    "\n",
    "For faster results, reduce the preset to `low` or `base`.\n",
    "If you just want [trustworthiness scores](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/4o-claude/), **avoid** using `best` or `high` presets. Those slower presets are for automatically [improving LLM responses](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/llm-accuracy/) returned by `TLM.prompt()`.\n",
    "`TLM.prompt()` using `medium`, `low`, or `base` preset returns the *same* response from the base LLM model that you'd ordinarily get. `TLM.prompt()` using `best` or `high` preset internally runs the base LLM multiple times to return a more trustworthy response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rigorous [benchmarks](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/trustworthy-language-model/) reveal that running TLM with the `best` preset can reduce the error rate (incorrect answers): of GPT-4o by 27%, of GPT-4 by 10%, and of GPT-3.5 by 22%.\n",
    "If you encounter token limit errors, try a lower quality preset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The range of the trustworthiness scores may slightly differ depending on your preset. Don't directly compare the magnitude of TLM scores across different presets (settle on a preset before determining score thresholds). What remains comparable across different presets is how these TLM scores _rank_ data or LLM responses from most to least confidently good.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other TLM Options\n",
    "\n",
    "When initializing a TLM instance, optionally specify the `options` argument as a dictionary of extra configurations beyond the quality preset. See the `TLMOptions` [documentation](/tlm/api/python/tlm/#class-tlmoptions). Here are useful options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **model**: Which underlying LLM model TLM should rely on. TLM is a wrapper method that can be combined with *any* base LLM API to get trustworthiness scores for that LLM and auto-improve its responses. For low latency/cost, specify a fast model like `nova-micro`. For high accuracy, specify a powerful model like `o3-mini`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **max_tokens**: The maximum number of tokens TLM should generate. Decrease this value if you hit token limit errors or to improve runtimes.\n",
    "\n",

If running multiple prompts simultaneously in batch, you'll need to stay under the rate limit, but you'll also want to optimize for getting all results quickly.\n",

    "If you are running TLM on big datasets beyond hundreds of examples, it is important to note that `TLM.prompt()` and `TLM.get_trustworthiness_score()` will fail if *any* of the individual examples within the provided list fail. This may be suboptimal. Instead consider using `TLM.try_prompt()` and `TLM.try_get_trustworthiness_score()` which are analogous methods, except these methods handle failed examples by returning a dictionary with `null` values for the `response` and `trustworthiness_score` keys, along with a `log` key containing detailed error information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The error information includes an error message describing the specific issue (such as exceeding token limits) and a boolean flag indicating whether the error is retryable. These methods still return results for the remaining examples in the provided list where TLM ran successfully. You can re-run examples with retryable errors to get results. This approach allows you to process the successful results while still having comprehensive information about any failures that occurred, enabling better error handling and potential retry strategies."

    "### Retrying Failed Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "When running large batches of prompts, some queries may fail due to issues like temporary network errors or timeouts. As recommended above, you can use the `TLM.try_prompt()` and `TLM.try_get_trustworthiness_score()` methods to handle the failed examples by returning a dictionary with detailed error information. By examining the log data in the response, you can efficiently retry only the queries that encountered retryable errors, without reprocessing the successful ones. This section demonstrates how you can implement a retry mechanism for the failed queries.\n",
