      "\n",
      "However, the function \"check_order_status\" expects an order ID, which is typically a unique alphanumeric code or number assigned to a purchase, not an email address. The user's input is ambiguous because they said \"Check status of order under my id: john_doe@email.com,\" which could mean they want to check an order associated with their email, but the function does not support searching by email, only by order ID.\n",
      "\n",

      "The user expresses frustration with their order and requests to speak with someone \"right away.\" The assistant responds by scheduling a callback at 9:00 AM with a topic describing the user's frustration. While scheduling a callback is a reasonable response, the user explicitly wants to speak with someone immediately, which implies urgency. The available tools specify that the assistant should transfer the customer to a human agent for urgent or complex issues or when the customer explicitly requests human assistance. The user\u2019s request to \"speak with someone right away\" fits this criterion, indicating a high urgency and a direct request for human interaction.\n",
