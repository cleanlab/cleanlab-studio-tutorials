    "[LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) helps you build fully-customizable Agentic AI systems tailored for your use-case. However due to LLM hallucinations, Agents occasionally produce **incorrect** responses, which erodes user trust and production readiness. This tutorial demonstrates how to **score the trustworthiness of responses** from *any* LangGraph Agent in real-time, and **prevent incorrect responses from being served** to your users."

    "Our customer support Agent will be able to use various read-only Tools (functions without side-effects) in order to gather necessary information before answering the user. This tutorial shows how to automatically detect when the Agent's answer is untrustworthy (likely incorrect). Other agentic AI applications where you can apply the same code demonstrated here include: Research Agents (DeepResearch), AI Analysts, Advisor Agents, Sales/Marketing Agents, Data Processing Agents, i.e. applications where the Agent's response must be accurate.\n",

For *task-oriented* Agents, we instead recommend scoring the trustworthiness of *every* internal Agent output (LLM call) to prevent mistakes before a Tool that causes side effects is called."

      "Swiss Air is a premium airline based in Switzerland that offers a range of domestic and international flights to passengers. However, sometimes situations arise where passengers may need to cancel their flights. In such cases, it is important to understand the Swiss Air Cancellation Policy to avoid any confusion or additional charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swiss International Airlines Cancellation Policy\n",
      "In this article, we will provide you with everything you need to know about the Swiss Air Cancellation Policy, including how to cancel a Swiss Air flight, the fees associated with cancelling a flight, and the refund policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have booked a flight with Swiss Airlines but need to cancel it, it's important to understand their cancellation policy to avoid any unnecessary fees or charges.\n",
      "Swiss Airlines offers different fare types, each with their own specific cancellation terms and conditions. The most flexible fare types such as Flex and Business Flex allow you to cancel your flight up to 24 hours before departure without any penalty. For other fare types, cancellation fees may apply.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Fare Type**:\n",
      "   - **Flex Ticket**: Full refunds can be obtained without any cancellation fee.\n",
      "   - **Standard Ticket**: You can receive a full refund if you cancel within 24 hours of booking. If you cancel after that, cancellation fees apply, and you may only get a partial refund.\n",
      "   - **Economy Ticket**: Similar to the Standard Ticket, you can get a full refund if you cancel within 24 hours of booking. Post this period, cancellation fees apply, and only a partial refund may be possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **24-Hour Cancellation Policy**: If you cancel your flight within 24 hours of booking, you are entitled to a full refund regardless of the fare type.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cancellation Fees**: If you cancel your flight after the 24-hour period, cancellation fees can vary:\n",
      "   - **Flex Ticket**: No fee.\n",
      "   - **Standard Ticket**: Fees range from 100 to 250 CHF based on the route and timing.\n",
      "   - **Economy Ticket**: Fees range from 150 to 350 CHF based on the route and timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Guide for Cancellation**:\n",

In such cases, it is important to understand the Swiss Air Cancellation Policy to avoid any confusion or additional charges.\n",

The most flexible fare types such as Flex and Business Flex allow you to cancel your flight up to 24 hours before departure without any penalty. For other fare types, cancellation fees may apply.\n",
