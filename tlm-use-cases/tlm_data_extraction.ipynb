    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use Cleanlab's Trustworthy Language Model (TLM) to reliably extract data from unstructured text documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use TLM like any other LLM, just prompt it with the document text provided as context along with an instruction detailing what information should be extracted and in what format. While today's GenAI and LLMs demonstrate promise for such information extraction, the technology remains fundamentally unreliable. LLMs may extract **completely wrong (hallucinated) values** in certain edge-cases, but you won't know with existing LLMs. Cleanlab's TLM also provides a **trustworthiness score** alongside the extracted information to indicate how confident we can be regarding its accuracy. These TLM trustworthiness scores are significantly more reliable than existing measures of LLM confidence, and help you catch badly extracted information before it harms downstream processes.\n",

We see that this table only lists this product's supply voltage and backlight supply voltage, and there is no mention of the operating voltage. Like any standard LLM, the TLM finds it hard to extract the correct information (or realize that this information is not available) due to some confusion in specific terminology, and hence returns the wrong response. Furthermore, **3V DC** is also the incorrect supply voltage range.
