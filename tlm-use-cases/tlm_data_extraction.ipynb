    "You can use TLM like any other LLM, just prompt it with the document text provided as context along with an instruction detailing what information should be extracted and in what format. While today's GenAI and LLMs demonstrate promise for such information extraction, the technology remains fundamentally unreliable. LLMs may extract **completely wrong (hallucinated) values** in certain edge-cases, but you won't know with existing LLMs. Cleanlab's TLM also provides a **trustworthiness score** alongside the extracted information to indicate how confident we can be regarding its accuracy. TLM trustworthiness scores offer state-of-the-art automation to catch badly extracted information before it harms downstream processes.\n",
