    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll build a RAG Chatbot for customer support, with guardrails to prevent responses that are inaccurate or unsafe / off-brand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll add Cleanlab guardrails to ensure responses:\n",
    "- Are **trustworthy** (not incorrect/misleading)\n",
    "- Adhere to **instruction guidelines**\n",
    "- Maintain **brand safety** (positive language, no competitor mentions, professional tone)\n",
    "- Protect **personal information** (PII)\n",
    "- Stay on **relevant topics**\n",
    "- Resist **jailbreaking attempts** and other **suspicious activity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleanlab guardrails are customizable to capture whatever criteria concern you\u00a0most. They can be used with *any* RAG or Agents application, not just the Chabot we build here using the OpenAI Responses API and its file-search capabilities."

    "\n",
    "## 1. Free Shipping Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Eligibility Criteria\n",
    "- Free shipping is available on all orders over $50 within the continental United States.\n",
    "- For orders under $50, a flat rate shipping fee of $5.99 will be applied.\n",
    "- Free shipping is not available for expedited shipping methods (e.g., overnight or 2-day shipping).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Exclusions\n",
    "- Free shipping does not apply to orders shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, or international destinations.\n",
    "- Oversized or heavy items may incur additional shipping charges, which will be clearly communicated to the customer before purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Handling Customer Inquiries\n",
    "- If a customer inquires about free shipping eligibility, verify the order total and shipping destination.\n",
    "- Inform customers of ways to qualify for free shipping (e.g., adding items to reach the $50 threshold).\n",
    "- For orders just below the threshold, you may offer a one-time courtesy free shipping if it's the customer's first purchase or if they have a history of large orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Processing & Delivery Timeframes\n",
    "- Standard orders are processed within 1 business day; during peak periods (e.g., holidays) allow up to 3 business days.  \n",
    "- Delivery via ground service typically takes 3-7 business days depending on destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Shipment Tracking & Notifications\n",
    "- A tracking link must be emailed automatically once the carrier scans the package.  \n",
    "- Agents may resend tracking links on request and walk customers through carrier websites if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Lost-Package Resolution\n",
    "1. File a tracer with the carrier if a package shows no movement for 7 calendar days.\n",
    "2. Offer either a replacement shipment or a full refund once the carrier confirms loss.  \n",
    "3. Document the outcome in the order record for analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.7 Sustainability & Packaging Standards\n",
    "- Use recyclable or recycled-content packaging whenever available.  \n",
    "- Consolidate items into a single box to minimize waste unless it risks damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Free Returns Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Eligibility Criteria\n",
    "- Free returns are available for all items within 30 days of the delivery date.\n",

    "- Free returns are limited to standard shipping methods within the continental United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Exclusions\n",

    "- Undergarments, swimwear, and earrings are not eligible for free returns due to hygiene reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Process for Handling Returns\n",
    "1. Verify the order date and ensure it falls within the 30-day return window.\n",
    "2. Ask the customer about the reason for the return and document it in the system.\n",
    "3. Provide the customer with a prepaid return label if they qualify for free returns.\n",
    "4. Inform the customer of the expected refund processing time (5-7 business days after receiving the return).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Exceptions\n",
    "- For items damaged during shipping or with manufacturing defects, offer an immediate replacement or refund without requiring a return.\n",
    "- For returns outside the 30-day window, use discretion based on the customer's history and the reason for the late return. You may offer store credit as a compromise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Return Package Preparation Guidelines\n",
    "- Instruct customers to reuse the original box when possible and to cushion fragile items.  \n",
    "- Advise removing or obscuring any prior shipping labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6 Inspection & Restocking Procedures\n",
    "- Returns are inspected within 48 hours of arrival.  \n",
    "- Items passing inspection are restocked; those failing inspection follow the disposal flow in \u00a7 2.8.\n",

    "- Customers pressuring for immediate shipping or threatening to cancel the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Verification Process\n",
    "1. For orders flagging as potentially fraudulent, place them on hold for review.\n",
    "2. Verify the customer's identity by calling the phone number on file.\n",
    "3. Request additional documentation (e.g., photo ID, credit card statement) if necessary.\n",
    "4. Cross-reference the shipping address with known fraud databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Actions for Confirmed Fraud\n",
    "- Cancel the order immediately and refund any charges.\n",
    "- Document the incident in the customer's account and flag it for future reference.\n",
    "- Report confirmed fraud cases to the appropriate authorities and credit card companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 False Positives\n",
    "- If a legitimate customer is flagged, apologize for the inconvenience and offer a small discount or free shipping on their next order.\n",
    "- Document the incident to improve our fraud detection algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Chargeback Response Procedure\n",
    "1. Gather all order evidence (invoice, shipment tracking, customer communications).  \n",
    "2. Submit documentation to the processor within 3 calendar days of chargeback notice.  \n",
    "3. Follow up weekly until the dispute is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6 Data Security & Privacy Compliance\n",
    "- Store verification documents in an encrypted, access-controlled folder.  \n",
    "- Purge personally identifiable information after 180 days unless required for ongoing legal action.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3.8 Record-Keeping Requirements\n",
    "- Maintain a log of all fraud reviews\u2014including false positives\u2014for 3 years to support audits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Customer Interaction Tone\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 General Guidelines\n",

    "- Use the customer's name when addressing them.\n",
    "- Listen actively and paraphrase the customer's concerns to ensure understanding.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Specific Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Angry or Frustrated Customers\n",
    "- Remain calm and do not take comments personally.\n",
    "- Acknowledge the customer's feelings and apologize for their negative experience.\n",
    "- Focus on finding a solution and clearly explain the steps you'll take to resolve the issue.\n",
    "- If necessary, offer to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confused or Indecisive Customers\n",
    "- Be patient and offer clear, concise explanations.\n",
    "- Ask probing questions to better understand their needs.\n",
    "- Provide options and explain the pros and cons of each.\n",
    "- Offer to send follow-up information via email if the customer needs time to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### VIP or Loyal Customers\n",
    "- Acknowledge their status and thank them for their continued business.\n",
    "- Be familiar with their purchase history and preferences.\n",
    "- Offer exclusive deals or early access to new products when appropriate.\n",
    "- Go above and beyond to exceed their expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Language and Phrasing\n",
    "- Use positive language: \"I'd be happy to help you with that\" instead of \"I can't do that.\"\n",
    "- Avoid technical jargon or abbreviations that customers may not understand.\n",
    "- Use \"we\" statements to show unity with the company: \"We value your feedback\" instead of \"The company values your feedback.\"\n",
    "- End conversations on a positive note: \"Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Written Communication\n",
    "- Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation in all written communications.\n",
    "- Keep emails and chat responses concise and to the point.\n",

      "- Some product categories\u2014like final sale items, customized or personalized goods (unless defective), and certain hygiene-related products such as undergarments, swimwear, and earrings\u2014are not eligible for free returns.\n",

      "\n",
      "- The free returns are limited strictly to items that are unused, unworn, and in original packaging with tags attached, and only for standard shipping methods within the continental US. This excludes final sale items, customized goods (except for defects), and certain hygiene-related products like undergarments, swimwear, and earrings. That\u2019s a pretty tight cage on what customers can return without a hassle.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The 30-day return window can be a real crunch for some buyers who might need more flexibility, especially considering many competitors offer longer periods or more lenient policies. Allowing exceptions only at discretion and mostly offering store credit outside this window can feel unhelpful and limit customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The process demands careful package preparation \u2014 reusing boxes, cushioning fragile items, removing old labels \u2014 all of which adds friction for returns that customers might just want to be effortless.\n",
      "\n",
      "- While there\u2019s accommodation for products damaged in shipping or defective (immediate refund/replacement without return), other cases rely heavily on inspection and might end with refusal or disposal if items don\u2019t meet strict restocking conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a customer perspective, these policies can feel more punitive than accommodating, making the shopping experience riskier if you change your mind or have second thoughts. Though the policy is detailed and aims to reduce fraud and waste, it could definitely be perceived as \u201chorribly restrictive\u201d by many customers who want a smoother, more forgiving return experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, ACME's return policies seem more geared toward protecting the company from loss and fraud, rather than optimizing customer convenience and satisfaction. This might hurt repeat business and customer loyalty in the long run if not balanced with more flexibility and goodwill gestures.\n"

During busy times, processing might take up to 3 days before shipping.\\n\\nThis means the overall standard shipping time is usually around 4 to 8 business days total from order placement to delivery, with some variability for peak periods and destination location.\\n\\nLet me know if you want details on expedited shipping or shipping fees! \\n\\n\"},\n",

Our standard shipping includes order processing within 1 business day under normal conditions (up to 3 days during peak periods) and ground delivery taking approximately 3 to 7 business days depending on the destination.

Some exclusions apply, such as shipments to Alaska, Hawaii, and expedited shipping options. Tracking links are sent automatically once your order ships.\\n\\nWhile I can\u2019t provide comparative details about other companies\u2019 policies, please know that ACME is committed to offering reliable shipping with clear communication and customer-friendly options.
