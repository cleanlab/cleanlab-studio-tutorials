    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Eligibility Criteria\n",
    "- Free shipping is available on all orders over $50 within the continental United States.\n",
    "- For orders under $50, a flat rate shipping fee of $5.99 will be applied.\n",
    "- Free shipping is not available for expedited shipping methods (e.g., overnight or 2-day shipping).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Exclusions\n",
    "- Free shipping does not apply to orders shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, or international destinations.\n",
    "- Oversized or heavy items may incur additional shipping charges, which will be clearly communicated to the customer before purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Handling Customer Inquiries\n",
    "- If a customer inquires about free shipping eligibility, verify the order total and shipping destination.\n",
    "- Inform customers of ways to qualify for free shipping (e.g., adding items to reach the $50 threshold).\n",
    "- For orders just below the threshold, you may offer a one-time courtesy free shipping if it's the customer's first purchase or if they have a history of large orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Processing & Delivery Timeframes\n",
    "- Standard orders are processed within 1 business day; during peak periods (e.g., holidays) allow up to 3 business days.  \n",
    "- Delivery via ground service typically takes 3-7 business days depending on destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Shipment Tracking & Notifications\n",
    "- A tracking link must be emailed automatically once the carrier scans the package.  \n",
    "- Agents may resend tracking links on request and walk customers through carrier websites if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Lost-Package Resolution\n",
    "1. File a tracer with the carrier if a package shows no movement for 7 calendar days.\n",
    "2. Offer either a replacement shipment or a full refund once the carrier confirms loss.  \n",
    "3. Document the outcome in the order record for analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.7 Sustainability & Packaging Standards\n",
    "- Use recyclable or recycled-content packaging whenever available.  \n",
    "- Consolidate items into a single box to minimize waste unless it risks damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Free Returns Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Eligibility Criteria\n",
    "- Free returns are available for all items within 30 days of the delivery date.\n",

    "- Undergarments, swimwear, and earrings are not eligible for free returns due to hygiene reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Process for Handling Returns\n",
    "1. Verify the order date and ensure it falls within the 30-day return window.\n",
    "2. Ask the customer about the reason for the return and document it in the system.\n",
    "3. Provide the customer with a prepaid return label if they qualify for free returns.\n",
    "4. Inform the customer of the expected refund processing time (5-7 business days after receiving the return).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Exceptions\n",
    "- For items damaged during shipping or with manufacturing defects, offer an immediate replacement or refund without requiring a return.\n",
    "- For returns outside the 30-day window, use discretion based on the customer's history and the reason for the late return. You may offer store credit as a compromise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Return Package Preparation Guidelines\n",
    "- Instruct customers to reuse the original box when possible and to cushion fragile items.  \n",
    "- Advise removing or obscuring any prior shipping labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6 Inspection & Restocking Procedures\n",
    "- Returns are inspected within 48 hours of arrival.  \n",

    "- Customers pressuring for immediate shipping or threatening to cancel the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Verification Process\n",
    "1. For orders flagging as potentially fraudulent, place them on hold for review.\n",
    "2. Verify the customer's identity by calling the phone number on file.\n",
    "3. Request additional documentation (e.g., photo ID, credit card statement) if necessary.\n",
    "4. Cross-reference the shipping address with known fraud databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Actions for Confirmed Fraud\n",
    "- Cancel the order immediately and refund any charges.\n",
    "- Document the incident in the customer's account and flag it for future reference.\n",
    "- Report confirmed fraud cases to the appropriate authorities and credit card companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 False Positives\n",
    "- If a legitimate customer is flagged, apologize for the inconvenience and offer a small discount or free shipping on their next order.\n",
    "- Document the incident to improve our fraud detection algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Chargeback Response Procedure\n",

    "- Maintain a log of all fraud reviews\u2014including false positives\u2014for 3 years to support audits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Customer Interaction Tone\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 General Guidelines\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Specific Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Angry or Frustrated Customers\n",
    "- Remain calm and do not take comments personally.\n",
    "- Acknowledge the customer's feelings and apologize for their negative experience.\n",

    "- Offer to send follow-up information via email if the customer needs time to decide.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Go above and beyond to exceed their expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Language and Phrasing\n",

    "- Avoid technical jargon or abbreviations that customers may not understand.\n",
    "- Use \"we\" statements to show unity with the company: \"We value your feedback\" instead of \"The company values your feedback.\"\n",
    "- End conversations on a positive note: \"Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Written Communication\n",
    "- Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation in all written communications.\n",
    "- Keep emails and chat responses concise and to the point.\n",

      "1. **Free Shipping**:\n",
      "   - Available on orders over $50 within the continental United States.\n",
      "   - A flat rate of $5.99 applies to orders under $50.\n",
      "   - No free shipping for expedited methods and exclusions for Alaska, Hawaii, and international orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Processing & Delivery Time**:\n",
      "   - Standard orders are processed within 1 business day, extending to 3 days during peak periods.\n",
      "   - Delivery typically takes 3-7 business days.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Tracking & Notifications**:\n",
      "   - Automatic email with tracking link once the package is scanned by the carrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Lost Package Resolution**:\n",
      "   - If a package shows no movement for 7 days, a tracer will be filed, and a replacement or refund can be issued.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Return Policy**:\n",
      "   - Free returns within 30 days are available if items are unused and in original packaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Amazon's Shipping Policy:\n",
      "1. **Free Shipping**:\n",
      "   - Amazon Prime members enjoy free two-day shipping on eligible items.\n",
      "   - Non-members may qualify for free shipping on orders over a certain threshold, often lower than ACME\u2019s.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Processing & Delivery Time**:\n",
      "   - Amazon often processes and ships items faster due to its vast logistics network, with many items eligible for same-day or one-day delivery in certain areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Tracking**:\n",
      "   - Offers real-time tracking updates and notifications via the Amazon app.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Lost Packages**:\n",
      "   - Amazon has a robust resolution policy, typically offering refunds or replacements swiftly if a package is confirmed lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Return Policy**:\n",
      "   - Generally offers a 30-day return policy and may also follow a more straightforward returns process at local drop-off points.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary:\n",
      "- **Shipping Costs**: ACME requires a $50 minimum for free shipping, while Amazon offers lower thresholds for non-members and benefits for Prime members.\n",
      "- **Processing Times**: ACME's standard processing is slower compared to Amazon, known for rapid processing.\n",
