    "Agentic AI applications \u2014 such as those built using the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) \u2014 orchestrate tools and language models to carry out complex user tasks. But like any system built on LLMs, Agents can still hallucinate, occasionally generating **incorrect** or misleading responses that undermine user trust. This tutorial shows how to **evaluate and score the trustworthiness** of any OpenAI Agent\u2019s responses in real-time using Cleanlab, and how to **automatically block untrustworthy outputs** from reaching your users.\n"

However, sometimes situations arise where passengers may need to cancel their flights. In such cases, it is important to understand the Swiss Air Cancellation Policy to avoid any confusion or additional charges.\n",

      "\n",
      "If you have booked a flight with Swiss Airlines but need to cancel it, it's important to understand their cancellation policy to avoid any unnecessary fees or charges.\n",
      "Swiss Airlines offers different fare types, each with their own specific cancellation terms and conditions. The most flexible fare types such as Flex and Business Flex allow you to cancel your flight up to 24 hours before departure without any penalty. For other fare types, cancellation fees may apply.\n",
      "If you cancel your Swiss Airlines flight outside of the 24-hour window, cancellation fees will be charged depending on your fare type and the time of cancellation. For example, if you cancel a non-flexible economy class ticket, a cancellation fee will be charged. The closer you cancel to the departure date, the higher the cancellation fee.\n",
      "In some cases, Swiss Airlines may allow you to make changes to your flight instead of cancelling it outright. However, these changes may also come with fees or penalties depending on your fare type and the type of change requested.\n",

      "Yes, you may be eligible for a refund if you cancel your flight with Swiss Airlines, but it depends on the type of ticket you purchased and when you cancel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the key points regarding Swiss Airlines' refund policy:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **24-Hour Cancellation Policy**: If you cancel your flight within 24 hours of booking, you can receive a full refund, regardless of the fare type.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Fare Types and Refund Eligibility**:\n",
      "    - **Flex Ticket**: You can cancel your flight without incurring any penalties and receive a full refund.\n",
      "    - **Standard Ticket**: If you cancel within 24 hours of booking, you can receive a full refund. Outside of this window, cancellation fees apply, and you may receive a partial refund.\n",
      "    - **Economy Ticket**: Similar to the Standard Ticket, you can get a full refund if you cancel within 24 hours. After that, cancellation fees apply, and a partial refund may be issued.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cancellation Fees**: If you cancel after the 24-hour window, the fees can range from 100 to 350 CHF, depending on your fare type and how close to the departure date you cancel.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **No Refund for Non-Refundable Tickets**: If you have a non-refundable ticket, you may not be eligible for a refund or may receive only a partial refund.\n",

      "5. **Circumstances Beyond Your Control**: If Swiss Airlines cancels your flight for reasons such as extraordinary circumstances (e.g., bad weather), you may be entitled to a full refund or rebooking options.\n",

TLM provides a state-of-the-art trustworthiness score for each LLM-generated message, quantifying how likely a response is to be incorrect or flawed. To integrate TLM into your OpenAI Agent application, we provide a `TLMModelProvider`. By including `TLMModelProvider` in your run configuration (or wrapping your own `ModelProvider`), your Agent model will automatically use our wrapper\u2014whether you specify the `model` argument as a `string` or as a `Model` object. Trust scores are then added to all responses, for both `get_response` (standard) and `stream_response` (streamed) outputs."
