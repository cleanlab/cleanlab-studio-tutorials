    "In zero-shot classification, we use a Foundation model to classify input data into predefined categories (aka. *classes*), without having to train this model on a dataset manually annotated with these categories. This utilizes the pre-trained model's world knowledge to accomplish tasks that would require much more work training classical machine learning models from scratch. The problem with zero-shot classification of text with LLMs is **we don't know which LLM classifications we can trust**. Most LLMs are prone to *hallucination* and will often predict a category even when their world knowledge does not suffice to justify this prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how you can easily replace any LLM with Cleanlab's [Trustworthy Language Model (TLM)](/tlm/tutorials/tlm/) to **gauge the trustworthiness of each zero-shot classification**, as well as automatically boosting classification accuracy. Use TLM to ensure **reliable classification** where you identify which model predictions cannot be trusted. This can be useful for automated data labeling, by revealing which subset of the data can be confidently handled by the LLM vs. which data requires human annotation."

      "          The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II is issuing a notice of intent to delete the V&M/Albaladejo Superfund Site (Site), located in the Almirante Norte Ward of the municipality of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, from the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comment on this action. The NPL is Appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR part 300, which EPA promulgated pursuant to Section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended. The EPA and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, through the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board, have determined that all appropriate response actions under CERCLA have been completed and that the Site poses no significant threat to public health or the environment. In the \u201cRules and Regulations\u201d Section of today's Federal Register, we are publishing a direct final notice of deletion of the V&M/Albaladejo Superfund Site without prior notice of this action because we view this as a noncontroversial revision and anticipate no significant adverse comment. We have explained our reasons for this deletion in the preamble to the direct final deletion. If we receive no significant adverse comment(s) on this action, we will not take further action on this notice of intent to delete. If we receive significant adverse comment(s), we will withdraw the direct final notice of deletion and it will not take effect. We will, as appropriate, address all public comments. If, after evaluating public comments, EPA decides to proceed with deletion, we will do so in a subsequent final deletion notice based on this notice of intent to delete. We will not institute a second comment period on this notice of intent to delete. Any parties interested in commenting must do so at this time. For additional information, see the direct final notice of deletion which is located in the Rules section of this Federal Register.\n",
