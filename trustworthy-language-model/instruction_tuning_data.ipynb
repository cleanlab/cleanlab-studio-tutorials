Otherwise, sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is irrational. Let a = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) and b = sqrt(2). Then a ^ b = (sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2)) ^ sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) ^ (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2) ^ 2 = 2, which is rational.

       "4  Here is a proof by cases that there exist two irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational. First, consider a = b = sqrt(2). Recall that sqrt(2) is irrational, so If a^b = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is rational, we are done because we have found irrational a and b with a^b being a rational number. Otherwise, sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is irrational. Let a = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) and b = sqrt(2). Then a ^ b = (sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2)) ^ sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) ^ (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2) ^ 2 = 2, which is rational. So either way, we can find irrational a and b with a^b being rational.   \n",

It was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users, who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos each day. As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.\\n\\nIn October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion. Google's ownership of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of 9 billion from the previous year.\\n\\nSince its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have also created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a larger audience.\\n\\nYouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite all its growth and success, YouTube has been widely criticized. Criticism of YouTube includes the website being used to facilitate the spread of misinformation, copyright issues, routine violations of its users' privacy, enabling censorship, their guidelines and how they are implemented, and endangering child safety and wellbeing.</td>\n",

       "8   YouTube is an American global online video sharing and social media platform headquartered in San Bruno, California, United States. It was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users, who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos each day. As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.\\n\\nIn October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion. Google's ownership of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of 9 billion from the previous year.\\n\\nSince its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have also created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a larger audience.\\n\\nYouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite all its growth and success, YouTube has been widely criticized. Criticism of YouTube includes the website being used to facilitate the spread of misinformation, copyright issues, routine violations of its users' privacy, enabling censorship, their guidelines and how they are implemented, and endangering child safety and wellbeing.   \n",

You may or may not have noticed, considering your obliviousness to anything that isn\u2019t food related, that you actually live in a house with other animals.  Now this may come as a shock to you, but I really don\u2019t appreciate the messes you leave around the house, the constant barking at random things outside, your lack of personal hygiene, and just your overall presence in general.\\n\\nTo put it into terms you can understand: You\u2019re messy, you\u2019re loud, you stink, and I want you out of the house.\\n\\nNow I can appreciate that this may come as a surprise to you. From my perspective you appear to be oblivious to your surroundings and your memory is atrocious, for example you bark at the mailman every day, despite him clearly being no threat to anyone. So I can understand if you\u2019re surprised by the revelation that I don\u2019t like you, and I want you to go away. You certainly haven\u2019t clued in every time you\u2019ve assaulted me with your disgusting wet nose and horrendous breath despite my clearly negative reaction.\\n\\nSo I would like to spell things out to you in as simple terms as possible.  I want you gone by tomorrow. Anything less is unacceptable and will result in an escalation on my part to ensure your life in this house is as intolerable for you as you\u2019ve made it for me. I have lived here longer than you, you have invaded my home, therefore the impetus is on you to leave.\\n\\nI will not be sad to see you go, and I hope to never see you again, but nevertheless wish you well on your journey.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMittens the Cat</td>\n",

       "20  Dear Drooling Moron,\\n\\nI write to you today to express my discontent (that means unhappiness) regarding our current living situation.  You may or may not have noticed, considering your obliviousness to anything that isn\u2019t food related, that you actually live in a house with other animals.  Now this may come as a shock to you, but I really don\u2019t appreciate the messes you leave around the house, the constant barking at random things outside, your lack of personal hygiene, and just your overall presence in general.\\n\\nTo put it into terms you can understand: You\u2019re messy, you\u2019re loud, you stink, and I want you out of the house.\\n\\nNow I can appreciate that this may come as a surprise to you. From my perspective you appear to be oblivious to your surroundings and your memory is atrocious, for example you bark at the mailman every day, despite him clearly being no threat to anyone. So I can understand if you\u2019re surprised by the revelation that I don\u2019t like you, and I want you to go away. You certainly haven\u2019t clued in every time you\u2019ve assaulted me with your disgusting wet nose and horrendous breath despite my clearly negative reaction.\\n\\nSo I would like to spell things out to you in as simple terms as possible.  I want you gone by tomorrow. Anything less is unacceptable and will result in an escalation on my part to ensure your life in this house is as intolerable for you as you\u2019ve made it for me. I have lived here longer than you, you have invaded my home, therefore the impetus is on you to leave.\\n\\nI will not be sad to see you go, and I hope to never see you again, but nevertheless wish you well on your journey.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMittens the Cat   \n",

    "To get the most reliable model via LLM fine-tuning, first filter out the lowest-quality (prompt, response) pairs from your dataset. If you have the time/resources, consider manually correcting those responses flagged as low-quality where you spot obvious room for improvement. This sort of data curation helps you better fine-tune *any* LLM you want to (even though the data curation was based on TLM trustworthiness scores).\n",

Data quality matters greatly for in-context learning, just as in fine-tuning applications."
