Otherwise, sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is irrational. Let a = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) and b = sqrt(2). Then a ^ b = (sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2)) ^ sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) ^ (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2) ^ 2 = 2, which is rational.

       "4  Here is a proof by cases that there exist two irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational. First, consider a = b = sqrt(2). Recall that sqrt(2) is irrational, so If a^b = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is rational, we are done because we have found irrational a and b with a^b being a rational number. Otherwise, sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is irrational. Let a = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) and b = sqrt(2). Then a ^ b = (sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2)) ^ sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) ^ (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2) ^ 2 = 2, which is rational. So either way, we can find irrational a and b with a^b being rational.   \n",

In 1967, the country co-founded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Race riots broke out once more in 1969. Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore's policies for the next half-century. Economic growth continued throughout the 1980s, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999. During the 1980s, Singapore began to shift towards high-tech industries, such as the wafer fabrication sector, in order to remain competitive as neighbouring countries began manufacturing with cheaper labour. Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was formed. The Port of Singapore became one of the world's busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period.</td>\n",

Even though Delta Airline will refund me the cost of flight ticket, the last minute ticket for tomorrow's flight is extremely expensive, almost double the normal price. I have to get back to New York by tomorrow to attend a very important meeting so I have to pay for the ticket, plus one night stay at a hotel for tonight. \\n\\nWill you reimburse my hotel and ticket? If not, I will have to claim it through my travel insurance and I need two documents to support my case. First, the confirmation of my order. Second, I need a letter from you to state the reason of the cancellation and that Delta Airlines is not able to reimburse my loss. \\n\\nI understand that bad things happen sometimes but I am still annoyed by the last minute notice. You should have noticed me earlier so that I could have had more time to deal with it. \\n\\nPlease let me know if you need anything from me. You can reach me at 123-456-7890 or my email 123@gmail.com.</td>\n",

Op deze dag herdenken christenen de kruisiging en dood van Jezus. Jezus werd volgens de Bijbel veroordeeld tot de kruisdood door de Romeinse stadhouder Pontius Pilatus, op aandrang van het sanhedrin. Deze straf werd voltrokken op de heuvel Golgotha nabij de stad Jeruzalem. Goede Vrijdag volgt op Witte Donderdag en gaat vooraf aan Stille Zaterdag. Daarop volgt Pasen.   \n",
       "5   After being expelled from Malaysia, Singapore became independent as the Republic of Singapore on 9 August 1965, with Lee Kuan Yew and Yusof bin Ishak as the first prime minister and president respectively. In 1967, the country co-founded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Race riots broke out once more in 1969. Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore's policies for the next half-century. Economic growth continued throughout the 1980s, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999. During the 1980s, Singapore began to shift towards high-tech industries, such as the wafer fabrication sector, in order to remain competitive as neighbouring countries began manufacturing with cheaper labour. Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was formed. The Port of Singapore became one of the world's busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period.   \n",

       "22  Hi Delta Airline,\\n\\nI am Ao Ni, I send this email regarding a cancelled flight of mine and to request documents to claim my travel insurance. \\n\\nI just received an email from you that my flight from Las Vegas to New York today at 10 PM was canceled due to mechanical issues. Even though Delta Airline will refund me the cost of flight ticket, the last minute ticket for tomorrow's flight is extremely expensive, almost double the normal price. I have to get back to New York by tomorrow to attend a very important meeting so I have to pay for the ticket, plus one night stay at a hotel for tonight. \\n\\nWill you reimburse my hotel and ticket? If not, I will have to claim it through my travel insurance and I need two documents to support my case. First, the confirmation of my order. Second, I need a letter from you to state the reason of the cancellation and that Delta Airlines is not able to reimburse my loss. \\n\\nI understand that bad things happen sometimes but I am still annoyed by the last minute notice. You should have noticed me earlier so that I could have had more time to deal with it. \\n\\nPlease let me know if you need anything from me. You can reach me at 123-456-7890 or my email 123@gmail.com.   \n",

    "To get the most reliable model via LLM fine-tuning, first filter out the lowest-quality (prompt, response) pairs from your dataset. If you have the time/resources, consider manually correcting those responses flagged as low-quality where you spot obvious room for improvement. This sort of data curation helps you better fine-tune *any* LLM you want to (even though the data curation was based on TLM trustworthiness scores).\n",

Data quality matters greatly for in-context learning, just as in fine-tuning applications."
