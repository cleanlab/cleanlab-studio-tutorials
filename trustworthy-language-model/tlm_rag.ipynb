    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** has become popular for building LLM-based Question-Answer systems in domains where LLMs alone suffer from: hallucination, knowledge gaps, and factual inaccuracies. However, RAG systems often still produce unreliable responses, because they depend on LLMs that are fundamentally unreliable. Cleanlab's Trustworthy Language Model (TLM) offers a solution by providing trustworthiness scores to assess and improve response quality, **independent of your RAG architecture or retrieval and indexing processes**. To diagnose when RAG answers cannot be trusted, simply swap your existing LLM that is generating answers based on the retrieved context with TLM. This tutorial showcases this for a standard RAG system, based off a tutorial in the popular [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/) framework. Here we merely replace the LLM used in the LlamaIndex tutorial with TLM, and showcase some of the benefits. TLM can be similarly inserted into *any* other RAG framework.\n",
