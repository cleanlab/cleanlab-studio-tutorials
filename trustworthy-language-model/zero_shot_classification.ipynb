    "In zero-shot classification, we use a Foundation model to classify input data into predefined categories (aka. *classes*), without having to train this model on a dataset manually annotated with these categories. This utilizes the pre-trained model's world knowledge to accomplish tasks that would require much more work training classical machine learning models from scratch. The problem with zero-shot classification of text with LLMs is **we don't know which LLM classifications we can trust**. Most LLMs are prone to *hallucination* and will often predict a category even when their world knowledge does not suffice to justify this prediction.\n",

      "          EPA and NHTSA are announcing the location addresses for the joint public hearings to be held for the \u201cProposed Rulemaking to Establish Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards,\u201d published in the Federal Register on September 28, 2009. This joint proposed rulemaking is consistent with the National Fuel Efficiency Policy announced by President Obama on May 19, 2009, responding to the country's critical need to address global climate change and to reduce oil consumption. As described in the joint proposed rule, EPA is proposing greenhouse gas emissions standards under the Clean Air Act, and NHTSA is proposing Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended. These standards apply to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles, covering model years 2012 through 2016, and represent a harmonized and consistent National Program.
